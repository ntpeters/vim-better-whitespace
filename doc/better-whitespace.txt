*better-whitespace.txt*      better-whitespace


This plugin causes all trailing whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) to be
highlighted. Whitespace for the current line will not be highlighted while in
insert mode. It is possible to disable current line highlighting while in other
modes as well (see options below).

To blacklist certain filetypes, set 'g:better_whitespace_filetypes_blacklist'
to a list of the desired filetypes.


                                                *ToggleWhitespace*

Call :ToggleWhitespace to toggle whitespace highlighting on/off.

                                                *EnableWhitespace*

To enable whitespace highlighting, call :EnableWhitespace. This will enable
highlighting of extraneous whitespace for the entire file.

                                                *DisableWhitespace*

To disable whitespace highlighting, call :DisableWhitespace. This will disable
highlighting of extraneous whitespace for the entire file.

                                                *StripWhitespace*

To remove extra whitespace, just call :StripWhitespace.By default this
operates on the entire file. To restrict the portion of the file that it
cleans, either give it a range or select a group of lines in visual mode
and then execute it.

                                                *ToggleStripWhitespaceOnSave*

This enables/disables stripping of extra whitespace on file save.

                                                *CurrentLineWhitespaceOff*

Calling :CurrentLineWhitespaceOff with the option either 'hard' or 'soft' will
disable whitespace highlighting for the current line.

If 'hard' option is used, then all highlighting remains the same except that
the current line is not highlighted.
WARNING: Since this uses CursorMoved events to prevent highlighting of the
current line there is a chance this can cause a significant slow down of Vim,
especially with regard to large files.

If the 'soft' option is used, then highlighting will have a lower priority
potentially causing this highlighting to be overwritten by other, higher
priority highlighting.  The benefit is that there should be no slowdown with
this option.

                                                *CurrentLineWhitespaceOn

Call :CurrentLineWhitespaceOn to enable whitespace highlighting for the current
line. Highlighting is still disabled for the current line while in insert mode.

                                                *operator*
By default, an operator is provided mapped to: <leader>s.
To modify the key mapping for this operator, set g:better_whitespace_operator.
This operator will strip whitespace over the currently selected region in visual
mode, or for the following motion in normal mode.
Note: This operator will not be mapped if an existing, user-defined mapping is
detected for the provided operator value.
